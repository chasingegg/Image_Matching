## This is the user guide of the project.
## In this file, how to use our code to generate results is shown.

## Dependencies ##
* OpenCV 2.4.9
* libconfig++

## Build ##
Simply run make on the base directory to build the sample applications.

## Note of build ##
The current version of makefile is to build up executable file 'FastVersion'.
Remove the prefix '//' in ImageMatch.cpp line 94-96, and change 'FastVersion' to 'demo' in makefile to build excutable file 'demo'.

## Run FastVersion ##
Type > ./FastVersion <Dir1: directory of images> <Dir2: directory of images to be matched with the images in Dir1>
In this case, just type > ./FastVersion 01 02

Running FastVersion generates a file called 'result', which records the running result of each two images. 

## Run demo ##
Type > ./demo <Dir1: directory of images> <Dir2: directory of images to be matched with the images in Dir1>
In this case, just type > ./demo 01 02

Running demo not only generates the file 'result', but also show details, including displaying the image pairs as well as show the matchings between them. Press any key to let the process move to the next image pair and show the pair.

## How to use 'result' ##
The format of 'result':
'result' is generated by running either FastVersion or demo.
Line one shows the running result of matching 01/01.png with 02/01.png.
Line two shows the running result of matching 01/01.png with 02/02.png.
So on and so forth.
A number 1 means we claim a match between the two images, while 0 rejects the possibility of a match between them.

Usage:
Move the 'result' file into folder 'testAccuracy'.

## testAccuracy ##
After moving the file 'result' to this folder, just type > ./GetAccuracy to show the accuarcy of the system.
To rebuild the executable file, type > g++ GetAccuracy.cpp
